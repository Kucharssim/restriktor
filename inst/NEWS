Changes in Version 0.2-600
 o Released on CRAN (January 24, 2020)
 o Fixed bug; the penalty term value was not correct for the gorica(c). Since, 
 there is no nuisance parameter we need to substract 1 from the penalty term value. 
 This was only done for the hypothesized model (Hm) and not for the unconstrained 
 model (Hu) or the complement (Hc). 


Changes in Version 0.2-500
 o Released on CRAN (December 12, 2019)
 o Added support; small-sample size correction for type goric (goricc) and
 gorica (goricac)


Changes in Version 0.2-15
 o Released on CRAN (May 24, 2019)
 o Added support; Generalized Order-Restrikted Information Criterion Approximation (GORICA).
 This method can be applied to a wide variaty of statistical models. 
 

Changes in Version 0.1-80.911
 o Released on CRAN (October 31, 2018)
 o Fixed bug; the argument 'type' was not passed through
 

Changes in Version 0.1-80.811
 o Released on CRAN (September 26, 2018)
 o This is mainly a small maintenance release to pass the cran checks 
 
 
Changes in Version 0.1-70
 o Released on CRAN (August 25, 2017)
 
 o Fixed bug; the parametric and model-based bootstrap resulted in 
 an error for the Wald and score test-statistic (class rlm only).
 
 o Fixed bug; an error was given if mix.weights = "none" and no 
 constraints were specified.
 
 o The test-statistics for robust M- and MM-estimators have been 
 updated. For most bounded-influence estimators the error distribution 
 should be symmetric, otherwise the intercept and center of the 
 error distribution are confounded. Therefore, to compute the 
 test-statistics we now use the block that corresponds to the 
 inequality-constrained slope parameters in the covariance matrix 
 of the M- and MM-estimator.
 
 o Added support; the parametric bootstrap for shifted/relocated 
 cones is now supported for the gaussian family.
 
 o Added support; an order-constrained hypothesis can now be evaluated
 against its complement using the goric(...) function.
 
 o Added support; order-constrained estimates for the multivariate normal
 linear model. Currently, no standard errors (yet).
 
 o Added support; likelihood-ratio test-statistic for objects of class mlm.
